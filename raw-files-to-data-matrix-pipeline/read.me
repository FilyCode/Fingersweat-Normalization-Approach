First the .raw files need to prepared and summarized into a matrix (Samples as columns, features as rows). This has been done by converting them into .mzML files, running a mzMine Batch mode, with a subsequent SIRIUS annotation. All this can be either done by hand or by running the 'get_untargeted_annotated_features_from_raw_files.R' script. The resulting .csv file (+SIRIUS summary file) is used to run the data analysis. Metadata are also need, which can be create with 'create_metadata-file.R' which needs to be adapted depending on the experiment.
